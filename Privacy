We understand what you send through Venture may be extremely personal, therefore we strive to maintain a platform as anonymous as safety can allow for. The only people with access to command logs are direct developers that require it. Server moderators and/or owners, do not and will NEVER have access to what you send through venture, unless very specific criteria is met. In respect for your privacy and discord ToS, any legitimate messages sent through Venture will never leave the hands of the developers unless we fear for your immediate safety.

Where are command logs stored?
Command logs are stored in a private discord guild and are never transferred/forwarded to any sort of database off-site.

Why do we have command logs?
Because of how anonymous bots work, it is simply not safe to allow completely anonymous use. The Venture development team MUST ensure the bot is not being used for malicious purposes, and that we can stop it immediately if it does happen.

Can i request logs from me to be deleted?
Of course you can! Simply contact the developers directly with the button below this message and explain the situation :).
